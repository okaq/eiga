The debate started immadiately
after the anomalous radio wave signature
was discovered.

That it emanated from deep space was in question
only briefly.

But after Dr. Plonk and the team at New South Wales
Gigantic Southern Array were able to triangulate.

The origin was pegged at 3000 parsecs past
the Andromeda Cluster of Galaxies.

Somewhere between the Fujiskia Belt
and Noman's Void.

It began only as a whisper at first.

Rumblings about patterns in the frequency.

Perhaps it wasn't what they first surmised.

A very massive Alien Megastructure.

And so courage was mustered, misgivings put aside. And concerns
about embarrassment and humilation were shelved in care of

The Question That Needed To Be Asked

Until it was finally uttered aloud:
Technosignature or Biosignature?
