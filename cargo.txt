Tall ship explorers bringing goods
To Polynesia and the encounters they engendered

Canonical example of Islanders
keeping flowers in their houses
and thinking that would bring ships

"Is there really much difference
between worship rituals to achieve Kago 
and the Good Life promised
in modern advertisements
by the devotion to consumer goods"

We open on two parallel scenes
One in Imperial Tahiti
Two in Victorian London
