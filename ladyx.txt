"The Divorce of Lady X"

Like Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutti
A screwball romance
That builds in layers of
Absurdity stacked one upon another

We open on a timeless tableau
The foggy London street 
Outside a fashionable hotel
Where a rager is in full swing
When an announcement interrupts the bacchanal

"Due to inclement weather
A fog as thick as pea soup
It is advisable that guests not try
To return home
All rooms are unfortunately already booked
But guests are welcome to use the lobby's divans"

Attempts are made to coerce existing reservations
Into allowing the party to bunk up
In the antechabers of their suites

Everard finds himself in a sour mood
His train hours late, famished, two nite's sleepless
Seeking only a sandwich
Warming glass of port
And fresh linens on a king size bed

Lady X ignores the
"Please Do Not Disturb" sign
And proceeds to charm her way
Into the young fellows quarters

What follows is a pure delight
A night of innocent sleep over fun
Purely platonic
But ripe with meaningful, soulful confession
As each realizes they don't really know
Why they married their respective spouses
In the initial cause

In the spirit of last night's frolic
In which neither achieved any sonamblitude
They think nothing of enjoying
A full English breakfast together
Spirited and giggly over pots of cafe au lait

Reverberating out in concentric twists
From this quotidian repast
Are waves of innuendo, speculation and 
Deliberate mischaracterizations

Couples even begin to question their own conjugal harmony

Until finally word spreads like wildfire
To the most interested party
The husband of Lady X herself
