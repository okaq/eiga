"The Gravity Machine"

The discovery of the Millenium!

Gravity bends light
That much has been known to theorists
For as long as fourth dimensional space time
Has been conjectured

We open on Eddington's expeditions
A full solar eclipse by the moon
And the diffraction of fixed stars
By an arc second in its wake

Cut to the presentation at the Royal Society
"When I heard the learned astronomer"

And then a private meeting with Einstein
Still in Europe, before the ravages of war

The present moment
An entrepreneurial demonstration
Conjecture that this will transform
Not just Earth and its inhabitants
But the possibility of a cosmic empire
Spanning the galaxy
Right into its black hole core

After the explosive progress realized
By free mechanical work in the z-plane

It dawns on a new generation of theorists
That gravity can be "hacked" 
Its manipulated metadata providing
The avenue to endlessly, timelessly
Compute universally
Instantly, and with the results appearing
At any point in space and time so desired!
