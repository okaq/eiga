"Florence"

Futurist (as in Tristan Tzara)
reconception of E M Forester's classic
"Room With a View"

Setting is timeless Florence
Birth city of the Renaissance
Which itself engendered the Enlightenment
"The Medieval Athens"
Alien and Surreal landscape
As the figurines of yore
Masterpieces of Arnolfo and Andrea Pisano
Jut up against the levatating monoliths of a New Age

Air pod taxis are now the conveyance of choice
For the modern tourist
And yet still foot traffic remains
Quaint against the hum
Of hover boards and e-bikes

The new school is Digital Maximalism
Gino Sevirini "Dynamic Hieroglyphic of the Bal Tabarin", 1912
In glorious eye recog promotions about the Piazza

A glimpse into a guild economy
Defined almost 100% trade
In rare digital goods and services

But we open in the main on the inciting event
Of the original novel
Honey escapes her pensionne, her chaperone, her legacy
And is alone with her thoughts
Wandering the streets
Admiring the human forms in ecstacy
When the sublime hits her
A product of modern education
Whose emphasis on problem solving and machine intelligence
Eschews the classical humanitarianisms
Pounded into students for centuries
Of rote examinations in Ancient Greek and Latin

A scuffle, she faints, and is caught by
The one also confused, lost, searching for meaning
