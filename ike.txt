"Ike and Nehru"

1956. Gettysburg, PA

The meeting of the two most popular leaders
of a New Free World

The conceit here is voyeuristic, eavesdroppy
The distant political media attempting to capture
The Russian plants attempting to spy
The pundits attempting to sound plausibly intelligent

As they walk through the Fields of Glory
Ike's knowledge impresses the savant
His reply "we are all applied historians"
