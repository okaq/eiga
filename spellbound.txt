"Spellbound"

Updating a classic Hitchcock thriller
1945, Ingmar Bergman, Gregory Peck
for the distant future

We open in the Age of Rationality
Politics, War, Poverty, Disease
Have all been conquered
By the ubiquitous imperiality of GAI

Only irrationality and its discontents
remain a stubborn thorn in the side of progress

The exclusive priesthood of algorithmicists
That architect this advanced cybernetic civilization
believe it is within the realm of possibility
that this final "problem"
will yield to a potential "solution"

Scene opens the same way Hitchcock did it
On an institution for those dangerously insane
enough to attempt some sort of self harm
the veneer of Patient X's well crafted
personality crumbling in the light of reality
as it dawns on her, she cannot manipulate her
way back into the "freedom" of everyday existence
