Voynich manuscript claimed deciphered
by computational symbolicist
team in UK Bristol

Hearkens to lost pagen medieval traditions
that have vanished in the sands of time

It is a compendium of herbal remedies
therapeutic bathing and astrological readings
matters of the female mind body spirit

Manuscript compiled by Dominican nun, anonymous
Reference manual for the female royal court
To which her monastery was affiliated

Story opens on two parallel tales

Tyrrhenian Sea naval rescue from volcanic eruption
As news arrives at Castello Aragonese
An island castle and citadel off the coast of Ischia
Marie of Castille, Queen of Aragon seeks tranquility

Combined with the present moment
As scientists seek understanding and clues
Rescuing the past from obscurity and obsolescence
