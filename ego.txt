"The Ego Chamber"

His uncanny mind for tuning out distraction
Engendered a Prophetic Mind
Capable of extrapolating possible futures

A Meta-Narrative
Concerning a literary sci-fi writer
"Neither science nor fiction"
Who establishes his own private Goldeneye-esque
Work reatreat in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica

Powerful arabaca beans provide stimulus
To open the inner eye
Visions of what will be

As all his predictions over a lifetime of authorship
Become not just plausible but ubiquitous
He attracts the attention of the
Grand Architects of Civilization

His own mental state devolving into a shadow
Incapable of discerning the Fantastic Vision of Tomorrow
From the drudgery of Present Day
