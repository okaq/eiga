Imagining a Cosmos
in which Kardashev Type I-V Civilizations
all co-exist together in relativ anarchic harmony

Influences here are "hipster" sci-fi action drama
Neuromancer, Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Perfect Blue

We open on a zoom pan of the ultimate megastructure
sucking in entire galactic super clusters
for its material resource needs

There is a lyric poetic element to this
A tragic lyre songs of sentient life's ineluctible Fate
Once all matter has been harvested
Converted to energy and dissipated as waste heat
Into what liminal oasis boundary we never find out
But at that point we reach "Max-Entropy"
And all dissolves into chaos
Extinguishing finalement until the Great Reboot

But until that moment
All sentient life remains entertained by
The Neutrino Beamers

1,000,000 A.D.'s version of pirate radio

The deep dark secret of Pan-Galactic Civilization
Is that it is held together by Truth
A new form of information
Justified Belief

And the new sacerdotal acolytes
The keepers of this Neo Sacral Flame
Are the chattering charismatic conversationalists
Who string stanzas of spoken word poetry
Into transmissions that never die

For the neutrino is a reactionless particle
It swerves not for matter
But a strong gravitational lens
Can focus its beam
Increasing gain, diminishing attenuation
As it rallies through stellar ionic gas clouds

Such a formidable piece of technology
The power to use black holes themselves
As broadcast equipment
Could only be concieved
Implemented and controlled
By an advanced being
Perhaps of pure energy and intellect

The fact that it now binds All Life
Is something of an accident of psycho history
