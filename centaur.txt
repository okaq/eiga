How to Become a Centaur (2018)
https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/issue3-case

thats why doug (englebart) tied that brick
to a pencil -- to prove a point
of all the tools we've created to augment
our intelligence, writing may be most important
but when he "de-augmented" the pencil
by tying a brick to it
it became much, much harder to write even a single word
and when you make it hard to do the low-level
parts of writing, it becomes near impossible
to do the higher-level parts of writing
organizing your thoughts, exploring new ideas
and expressions, cutting it all down to what's essential
that was doug's message
a tool doesn't just make something easier
it allows for new, previously-impossible ways
of thinking, of living, of being
