The American Mythology

Film shorts of re-enactments of the stories
we were raised on, cautionary tales
and character building exercises

George Washington chopping down a cherry tree
and stating "I cannot tell a lie"

One such legend is Franklin's kite
soaring above a thunderstorm
with a solitary brass key dangling below
and a young assistant screaming to take shelter

Fear and superstition
give way to reason and understanding

This is a fictional imagining of 
Franklin's Eureka moment

Electricity in 1740
was the stuff of curiosity and parlor tricks

But Franklin had an insight he could not shake
