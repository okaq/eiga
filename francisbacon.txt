It's a game trailer for "Baterial Tactics"
Seed initiator game play mechanic

Open on the voice of a Mad Scientist
"What you don't see in the world
Falls upon you to create"

"They thought it would be contained"

"The playpen they build to arrest it's spread.
It wasn't sufficient"

"The Hubris of Men who claim empire over Mother Nature"

"Only to feel her venegeful wrath when transgressed"

One effect is to intersperse
Images and short clips shot on location
Even dial it down to stills
Desaturated and monochrome
And juxtapose with the latest FLIR micrographs
Of engineered proteins and organisms

Implication is out of the great minds
Are birthed supernatural horrors
That cannot be put back into Pandora's Box

"To arrest an existential threat
We invented an unholy fire"

Man's folly, and use of AI 
To err is human
Rational optimality erases mistakes
No matter how catastrophic

As we view images of The Academy
A short sci fi expository
The process, the sacrifice, the hope and despair
And finally the breakthrough
Exophiles, life under extremes

"Life (and living) where none can thrive"

"Engineered to propagate
under even the most uninhabitable dead zones"

"Wehere else could it aught go
But infinite space!"
