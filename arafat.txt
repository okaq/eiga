"Blame It On Arafat"

A studio. Pehaps its broadcast network television.
Or a podcaster in mom's basement. It's getting harder
to tell the difference anymore.

Tonight's debate. Yin versus Yang.
The pleasure principle versus the Platonic ideal.
Thus was it ever.
And so shall it ever be.

Open on the chit chat.
The awkward interchange before tape starts rolling.
It's meant to calm the pre-show jitters of both
host and guest alike.
But instead is a mere strained droning, with frequent 
interruptions as mics gets tests, levels tweaked.
No one wants to expend their talent in ephemera.

"...it's the sublime *beauty* of the decay process.
I throw an apple core on the ground. And minutes later
legion of miniscule worms regurgitate the yellowing fruit.
It's almost like a Lem novel!"

"Perhaps Poe was right"

"About?"

"The most poetic vision the world has to offer.
Is that of a maid, dying before her time"

"And on that note, perhaps we should begin..."

"Right-o. I am ready to be dissected by you"

"Nonsense. It's a convo. Just like one of our backyard bbqs"

"I just hope Merton doesn't show" [private joke]

MONTAGE

Fiddling with equipment. Getting it to work.
Capitulating and calling in A/V Wiz to work it.

Intros. A joke. Icebreakers. The first question.

Rolling dialogue. Spontaneous laughter. 

Sipping a water bottle.

Leaning in to make a counterpoint.

END MONTAGE

And finally the moment we've all been waiting for...

"...Watergate, of course, Bretton Woods and the Gold Standard"

"...naturally"

"Culminating in the Arab oil price shocks putting the final
nail in the coffin of The Good in American Culture."

"But surely the rot had already started! vonNeumann writing
in 1941 was already heeding the clarion to reduce carbon.
Just look at Times Square New York. Families by 1955 could
not wait to flle to Lovetown Long Island"
