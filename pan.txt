To put it simply
everything thinks and feels
its not just living humans and animals
that are in possession of an eternal soul

the counter pane is rank individualism

and the transcendence is
advaita vendanta
from the upanishads
of classical indian philosophy

brahamas energy is manifest
as maya, the illusion of the world
but
