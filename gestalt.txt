25 Ways of Looking at AI

There is a modus in exponentially 
Accelerating technology progress
Where the acolytes surpass the old masters

History and its application
Usually quite relevant in predicting outcomes
And preparing society for the coming New Age
Is in such instances obviated, made extraneous

We can imaging a humorous scenario
Where the generation gap produces such a chasm
Not just in manner and age
But in the disparity between
Theory and Praxis

We open on one of those academic theorist
Centers such as the Kavli Insitute in Santa Barbara

A circle of deep chairs
Golden afternoon sunlight streaming through picture windows
Deep blue Pacific beyond into infinity
Each chair occupied with a foremost Mind
The enlightened association tasked by society
To solve the Foundations of Machine Intelligence

At the head of the circle
90 year old physicist and dean of inquiries 
Into the Great Questions and Mysteries
As adept at peering into the human brain
As dissecting the black hole
At the center of the Milky Way

And bringing up the rear
A smattering of grad students in their twenties
Interested, bored, gossipy, enthralled, glued to screens
Just happy to be young and alive

Benevelont Dictator for Life
Of a leading AI software library
Breaks the ice with a seemingly simple query
"Is the brain digital or analog"?

The cryptic response
"Anything can be re-cast to any type you wish"
Elicits a rumination on the what the forebears
Would have thought
Those names familiar to all
Who are no longer extant
But whose presence is still very much felt
Weiner, Von Neumann, Church, Turing

And so unspools the long litany of past regressions
Snippets of memories and divergences
About conferences hitherto unspoken
For at least a quarter century
The Berlin School for Gestalt Thinking
Providing the pathway to Cybernetics
And its ultimate destination of Cloud based modern AI
And its roots in Bayesian thinking

When a single solitary voice in the back
Can no longer hold his peace nor his tongue
"Rubbish!"
