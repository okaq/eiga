"I'm Intuitive"

This scene is culled
from an interview with
WeWork founder Rebekah Neuman

Nothing against her
She founded a successful Unicorn
Is the mother of five children
And certainly beloved of 
friends of family alike

But Man cannot live on Faith alone
He requires absolute proofs of Truth
And we can easily glean how an
"irrational overconfidence"
in ones percieved "superpowers"
Can land one in the soup
