Snippets overheard at a raging
art gallery event
Hudson Yards, NYC

quick cuts from one party to the next
with wild interstitials of excess

"Gee, I think I could do that"
"Of course! Once it's finished
anyone can copy it again"
"I don't getcha?"
"You have to do The Next One.
Art is a progression.
You must visualize into the future
and manifest that vision
into an object in the present moment!"
"I think I could..."
"But you wont"
"Why not"
"Because of what people might think
if they see what really goes on
inside that mind of yours"

"...and then he sampled a latent
space of ALL bivavlve mollusks..."
"Hmmmmm"
"...not just clams. Scallops. Oysters.
Mussels. Quahogs. Jackknifes. Pismos.
Seaworms. Geoducks..."
"It still doesn't look Natural?"
"That's kind of the point"
"Ere before Machine go I, eh"

"It's CPG in the style of Brancusi,
with a hint of Modigliani for measure"
"It's hideous. I love it,
but where am I going to put it"
"It would look great in Aspen
right above the towel heaters in the
indoor saunas guest changing cabana"
"Well how much is it?"
"We could let it go for one five""
"I'll have to ask Obanjo, my art guru"
"Mitzi! I thought I was your art guru!"
