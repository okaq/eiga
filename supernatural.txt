"The Supernatural Citizen"

Re-work of Shakespeare's Macbeth
Complete with Scottish highlands setting
But wherein Macbeth is both
The hero that quashed the treasonous uprising
And the prophetic bewitching oracles himself

This acts as counterpoint
To the idea of Life
As war between Good vs Evil
And instead introduces concepts of Dharma
To the mass audience

There is the Man of lives his Destiny
And the Antagonist, thwarted from living his
Macbeth still has the ambition
Of usurping the grand throne
But by being a seer
Envisioning a future as clearly as past history
He can alter so subtlely the course of events
As to commit the perfect crime
