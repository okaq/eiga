"Flesh and Blood"

Reworking of a scene from The Omen 1976

Diplomat Roger Thorn is in his office
talking with some subordinates about cancelling
A proposed trip to Saudi Arabia
Due to the recent horrific event
That occurred during Daminan's birthday celebration

A secaratary announces over the phone
That a "Catholic Priest from Rome"
Has arrived demanding a personal meeting
And only needs a minute or two

It's played very awkward, embarrassing
The tension with having to ask
Security to remove a man of the sacerdotal class
Is quite destabilizing

All the while he beseeches thorn
That the only salvation
Is in "eating the flesh of Christ"
and "drinkning His holy blood"

In our modern version
We open on a metro co-working paradise
Where a new team is about to close
The first Major Deal of the young lives
It is the moment their lives will truly change

When suddenly they are interupted
By a visitor from Vatican

The light banter gives way to panic

An element of the supernatural
Invades a space hitherto consecrated to irrationality

As the narrative arc focuses
On one member of the team
Perhaps its de facto leader
Who has remained unusally quiet

"Father...blood alone may not suffice"
