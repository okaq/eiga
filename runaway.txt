"Runaways"

A bureau tasked with controlling
Existential threats to humanity
Due to "runaway" exponential technological progress

When inventions break free
Of pristine labratory environments
And cannot be contained by the scientists
Who brought them to life
And begin wreaking havok on their environments
Without innate sense of judgement or morality
Radical unforseen consequences are afoot!

Concerning the "Grey Goo" of the techno-sphere
Ice-9 that freezes all water permanently
Large Hadron collisions exhibiting a 0.000001% chance
Of opening a WormHole in the Grenoble Valley of Southern France

This treatment is not so much for a 
"Monster of the week" style episodic crime procedural
But rather a probing psychological exploration
Of the character required to imagine
As well as mitigate
Existential threats to Humanity

A distinct possibility
Impending environmental collapse
Tends to radicalize and unhinge the Rational Mind
The battle within
Echoes the war without

The inciting event imagined here
Is an FBI psychological profile gone awry

Manhunter amongst The Theorists

G Men incample of comprehending the motivations
Of an explorer in the hidden realms
Of unexplainable natural phenomena
Who in seeking Ultimate Truth
Is rendered blind to 
The permanent alterations
To their environment

Exploration vs Exploitation
