Sufi poetry, Kahlil Ghibran, Rumi
The Conference of the Birds
Haiku of Basho, Issa
Astral Weeks by Van Morrison
Sound of Alan Watts' Voice
Erik Satie Gymnopedia
John Dowland Come 
I'm a sucker for period films
Howard's End, Sense and Sensibility
Classic anime from the "Golden Age"
Fruits Basket, Get Backers
Not sure who said it but
"Long walks in Nature,
are the cure for any ills"
I believe this World is an illusion
And a better one is to come
I take great comfort in a Truth
So profound as to be incomprehensible 
by mere mortal minds
And that it is not even Day Zero 
In the science of the brain
Human emotions are fleeting, temporary
Embrace everything
This, even this, sorrow and despair
And sing like the Slaves
Of Old Mississippi
Faces turned toward brightest heaven
"Roll, Jordan, Roll!"
