Upgrade of The Sandpiper (1965)
dir. by Vicente Minelli
star Burton / Taylor

A great, perhaps the most epic
film that embodies the sensibilities
and cultural aposophes
of The American Beat Movement

one star melodrama at best
it nonetheless is one of the movies
you just want to slip into and inhabit

Original plot is sparse
but foreshadowing what would come down in the
peace and love flower child youth quake

the definition of free spirit, laura
meets the traditionalist episcopal headmaster

we flip the script

it is the mainstream that now conforms
to being against any "society"

every school now teaches "bongo poetry"
and "sculpture al fresco au natural"

what the boy craves and needs
is discipline, honor, and an education

the setting remains the same
Big Sur, shot from open top jeeps

and the poetry mother teaches childe
geoffrey chaucers, the canterbury tales
sung in original middle english

Whan that Aprille with his shoures sote
The droghte of Marche hath perced to the rote
And bathed every veyne in swich licour
Of which vertu engendred is the flour
