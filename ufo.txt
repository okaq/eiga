"The UFO Hunters"

Akin to Storm Chasers
Who ride trucks laden with meteorological equipment
Directly into the Eye of the Storm

DoD and US Navy now admit
The exotic technology now exists
Capable of flying maneuvers
That shatter our preconceived science
And understanding of Inertial Mass
And Conservation of Energy

There are many ways to approach this story
But the original "The Thing" provides an avenue
Deep South Pole tension
As the unknown unknowns
Quickly reveal themselves in rapid succession

It is up to the boffins of the group
To react quickly
Both in comprehending the phenomena
That give rise to these feats of flying
As well as sympathy and strategy
In determining the purpose of alien encounters
And any possible combat advantage

An interesting aside or two
Is the frequency with which events happen
Around nuclear research facilities
As well as the possibility of
Deep sea alien "bases" with which to conduct operations
