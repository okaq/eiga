Burglars on the prowl
4am break in of a suburban manse
When they come upon a family
They assumed were away on vacay

It's the pre-dawn Ramadan feast
A legendary table spread
And the would be robbers
Are tempted by scents and flavors
Hitherto only imagined
In the Gardens of Paradise

They abandon their criminal enterprise
Make a few friends for life
Gain a window into their own destiny
Reflecting on lives spent living astray
