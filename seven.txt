7-Logic Quantum Minesweeper

In lieu of binary truth bombs
there are seven catagories of grid cell

1 True there is a bomb present
2 False there is no bomb here
3 And there is a bomb, there is no bomb
4 Nor there is neither a bomb, nor no bomb
5 Unknown state of the bomb
6 Unknowable state of the bomb
7 NULL nothing void empty of meaning

The quantum superposition dictates
that N different fields exist simultaneously
with probability 1/N each

Propositum

There's been a lot of angst about AI

Not just the usual fears
About a loss of privacy 
in the surveillance state
Or automated cyberwarfare 
targeting critical infrastructure

More of an existential threat 
to humanity's longevity as a species

Some say the risk of extinction due 
To an AI with the intellect of a God
and the moral sense of a two year old
is so actute that even a 1% probability
of it even coming to light
portends the expected oblivion of all life

There are others who claim the danger of
a benevolent super-intelligent is even graver
And that an all-giving machine that provides
life, energy, shelter, food, wealth and even love
would be too impossible to resist
and that humans would willingly barter all their humanity
for just the priviledge to worship this new AI as a Diety
All the old myths would fall by the wayside
and the only truth would be 
the truth of the machine

In light of these grave misgivings
and to demonstarte that such a fate is not
an historic inevitability

I propose to invent a series of games
that no machine could ever beat a human!
